title: Challenges in financial machine learning
—</p>

<p>Why is machine learning applied to financial data hard? What are the main differences of financial data compared to datasets where machine learning techniques work well.</p>

<h2 id="panel-model">Panel model</h2>
<ul>
  <li>$p$ assets.</li>
  <li>$n$ time steps.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Nonlinearity of conditional expectation
    <ul>
      <li>Deep neural network</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nonstationarity of conditional expectation
    <ul>
      <li>Financial markets are dynamic; old patterns are arbitraged away and new patterns emerge.</li>
      <li>The optimal weights of neural networks change smoothly over time  (there might also be sudden shocks).</li>
      <li>Layers close to the input are more stable while layers closer to the output must adapt quickly to new market dynamics.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hierarchical structure
    <ul>
      <li>Each asset/sector can have different weights (esp. in the last layer).</li>
      <li>But there is dependence.</li>
      <li>Even though the absolute amount of data is big when pooled. Data is limited relative to model complexity.</li>
      <li>Use covariance matrix as measure of similarity.</li>
      <li>Dirichlet process
        <ul>
          <li>Allows for infinite clusters but promotes sparsity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>High noise component with cross-sectional correlation and longitudinal volatility clusters.
    <ul>
      <li>Assets are correlated.</li>
      <li>Volatility is stochastic and autoregressive.</li>
      <li>Improve data efficiency of conditional expectation models by accounting for it.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For forecasting: Use stochastic volatility models or multivariate GARCH models.
        <ul>
          <li>Condition on events.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The dimensionality of the covariance matrix is high.
    <ul>
      <li>The number of assets is large relative to the sample size.</li>
      <li>Hence sample eigenvalues are over-dispersed and the sample covariance matrix is ill-conditioned.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prices are observed irregularly and with noise at high frequency.
    <ul>
      <li>Intraday prices contain microstructure noise and are observed non-synchronously across assets.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Estimates of uncertainty is important.
    <ul>
      <li>Bayesian framework allows for uncertainty estimates.</li>
      <li>A decision is always better if one accounts for uncertainty.</li>
      <li>Main portfolio optimization result is Markowitz:
        <ul>
          <li>optimal weights depend on mean and variance of returns.</li>
          <li>assumes first two moments are known.</li>
          <li>when estimates are used instead, need to account for epistemic uncertainty of estimates as well
            <ul>
              <li>Aleatoric uncertainty: noise inherent in the observations. (i.e. variance of returns)</li>
              <li>Epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model – uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. (i.e. variance of mean and variance estimates)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>2 and 3: Each point in asset-time has different weights, but there is dependence between them. Weights change smoothly over time and weights of similar stocks are themself similar. A stock is similar to another if it operates in the same industry. A company can have several arms, though. A stock can be correlated to many other stocks, the covariance matrix is the right object to encode this similarity.</p>
